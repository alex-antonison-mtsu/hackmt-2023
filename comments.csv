"Yea I know how it feels to have a sibling who abuses their parents love. My younger brother could literally be considered abusive to me mentally and sometimes even physically. He will hurt me so I will hurt him back. He will pretend cry and even if I apologize he runs to tell mom/dad and I will explain but he always wins because ""he's 9 and you're 13! Be the bigger person and just tell me!"" But when I tell them nothing gets done about it because ""you're fine!"" He knows what I hate and annoys me to the point where my only ways to find comfort is either slapping him or running to my room crying. If I slap him I'll get in trouble if I go to my room I'll get called a shut in. The other day my brother called me a w***e and my dad just told me to tell my mom and my mom only ""yelled"" at him. She mostly just said ""you don't ever call your sister or anyone else that!"" And lost his phone for an hour.
He hurts our 3 yo sister and gets away with it and he even teaches her to call me mean things.
I am sick of him and I avoid going places wirh him as much as possible.
Just now he is refusing to go with my mom just so he can stay here and annoy me. He is screaming and song in a really gross voice just to annoy me.

Same thing but with my younger sister. One time I was stuck in a five hour traffic jam with her and I felt like opening the door and running off at any second.,3.0,0.0

"I have a sibling that pulls this kinda shit. I have a pretty good feeling that he’s the reason behind my recently broken monitor. I just like to think that someday when he’s an adult, he will do some really dumb things and he’ll go to jail or something.",2.0,0.0
